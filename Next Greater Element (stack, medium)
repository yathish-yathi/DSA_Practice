//we will traverse from n->0 and use stack to track previous greater element
//if stack is empty no greater element update cur index of ans as -1
//else if top is greater than cur then thats the next greater value update cur index of ans with peek()
//else if top is less than or equals cur then use while loop and pop the stack untill
//the greater value is found or stack because empty
//if while loop broke due to stack becoming empty => no element is greater than cur so -1
//else while loop broke because we found greater element, update to ans with present peek

Next Greater Element

Given an array arr[ ] of size N having elements, the task is to find the next greater element for each element of the array in order of their appearance in the array.
Next greater element of an element in the array is the nearest element on the right which is greater than the current element.
If there does not exist next greater of current element, then next greater element for current element is -1. For example, next greater of the last element is always -1.

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 4, arr[] = [1 3 2 4]
Output:
3 4 4 -1
Explanation:
In the array, the next larger element 
to 1 is 3 , 3 is 4 , 2 is 4 and for 4 ? 
since it doesn't exist, it is -1.
Example 2:

Input: 
N = 5, arr[] [6 8 0 1 3]
Output:
8 -1 1 3 -1
Explanation:
In the array, the next larger element to 
6 is 8, for 8 there is no larger elements 
hence it is -1, for 0 it is 1 , for 1 it 
is 3 and then for 3 there is no larger 
element on right and hence -1.
Your Task:
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function nextLargerElement() that takes list of integers arr[ ] and N as input parameters and returns list of integers of length N denoting the next greater elements for all the corresponding elements in the input array.

Expected Time Complexity : O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space : O(N)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
0 ≤ Ai ≤ 1018
