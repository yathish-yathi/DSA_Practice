//=> If the total sum of array is SUM then sum of each partition will be SUM/2
//=> if one part is having sum/2 then other part will have sum/2 so our aim is to check that "is it possible to have sum/2 using any of elements present in array" (one partition)
//=> which nothing but subset sum proble in DP, where arr=arr and targer = sum/2 

Subset Sum Problem (DP, 0-1 knap sack, medium, tabular)


//==========
Partition Equal Subset Sum
Difficulty: Medium

Given an array arr[], return true if it can be partitioned into two parts such that the sum of elements in both parts is the same, otherwise, false.

Examples:

Input: arr = [1, 5, 11, 5]
Output: true
Explanation: The two parts are [1, 5, 5] and [11].
Input: arr = [1, 3, 5]
Output: false
Explanation: This array can never be partitioned into two such parts.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size ≤ 100
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1000
n*sum of elements ≤ 5*106
