//this from postfix so we start traversing from front
//here we pick each elemnt as string ch one by one from last
//pre_exp.substring(i, i+1); is used to get each letter as string here i+1 is ecluded so even if its out of bound no issues
//if ch is alphabet then add into stack
//else its operator so need to perform operation b/w top 2 element of stack
//But in this problem we need to create a string 
// In postfix first top is num2 and second top is num1 which will be reverse for prefix
//after generation string push string back to stack
//One all element is traversed only one element is left in stack which is out answer , pop and return it

Postfix to Infix Conversion
You are given a string that represents the postfix form of a valid mathematical expression. Convert it to its infix form.

Example:

Input:
ab*c+ 
Output: 
((a*b)+c)
Explanation: 
The above output is its valid infix form.
Your Task:

Complete the function string postToInfix(string post_exp), which takes a postfix string as input and returns its infix form.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

Constraints:

3<=post_exp.length()<=104
